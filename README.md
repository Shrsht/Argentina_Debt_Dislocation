# Exploring Future Dislocation Scenarios of Argentine Sovereign Debt:

This project is an attempt at analysing different scenarios that might lead to Dislocation in Argentina's Sovereign Debt. This analysis takes into account political and climactic factors along with recent updates on Argentina's ongoing IMF program.

## Dislocation Scenarios: 
- Cyclical Droughts and Persistant Climate Change
- Election Analysis and related Uncertainity
- Structural Issues and Fiscal Targets

# Drought and Climate Change Predictions:

This is *NOT* the first time Argentina is seeing drought conditions of this severity and the related losses to GDP are not unprecedented either. 

### Soybean Production Trends: 

- Argentina is being affectted by severe Droughts at an alarming frequency which is severely affecting its output of key GDP contributors - Soy, Corn and Dairy :
- We see a repeat in severe drought like conditions every 4-5 years on a continuous basis:

- Below is a chart of Soybean Output from Argentina over the past 40 years. From this chart alone we can observe that *frequency* and *intensity* of drought conditions has increased from the year 2000, and we can safely assume that this current 2022-23 drought condition will not be the last such major dought faced by Argentina.

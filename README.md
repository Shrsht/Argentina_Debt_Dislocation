# Argentina_Debt_Sustainability

This project is an attempt at analysing and making a Debt-Sustainability Prediction Analysis on Argentina by combining its political and climactic factors to predict the ability of Argentina to meet its goals set by the IMF. 

## Factors Affecting Debt Sustainability: 
- Drought and Climate Change
- Political Changes and related Uncertainity
- Structural Issues and Spending Problems
